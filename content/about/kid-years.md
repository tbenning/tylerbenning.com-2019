I grew up in the boonies in a farmhouse and had too much time to kill.
When I was 7, my brother taught me how to use our family computer. I
quickly discovered how magical computers can be.

I started playing games like Doom, Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and
SimCity daily. I learned to download music and burn mixed CDs to
impress friends at school. My friends’ parents started asking me to
fix their computers, and I even made a bit of money doing it. I
learned to use audio interfaces to record music, DV cameras to make
videos, and how to play around with graphics in Photoshop. I wasn’t a
child prodigy programmer, but I was a bit of computer whiz that could
learn new tools quick.

One day, my brother taught me about HTML. He showed me that if you
write in a notepad file and save it with <code>.html</code> at the
end, that the computer recognizes it as a web page. A couple of inline
styles and anchor tags later, and my Dragon Ball Z drawings and MS
paint renderings soon materialized into a homemade DBZ fan page.{' '}

A few things have happened from now since then (namely Myspace, bad
haircuts, puberty, university, a career) but I still get lost inside
my computer tinkering around and learning new ways to conjure things
onto the screen.
