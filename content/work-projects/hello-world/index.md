## Panda's Rock my fucking socks

Pandas are really sweet.

Here's a video of a panda eating sweets.

About Me
Product design is what I do at work everyday. Recently, I became interested in Javascript, React, and I built this site with Gatsby to boot. I think stories are an important part of design, and are what help people think on the same wavelength. This website is a place to share some of my own stories.

### Humble Beginnings

I grew up in the [boonies]() in a farmhouse and had too much time to kill. When I was 7, my brother taught me how to use our family computer. I quickly discovered that computers were magical, and that I could harness these powers. I started playing games like Doom, Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and SimCity daily. I learned to download music on Napster and burn mixed CDs for my Walkman to impress friends at school. My friendsâ€™ parents started asking me to fix their computers, and I even made a bit of money doing it. I learned to record music, make videos, and how to play around with Photoshop. While not a child programmer prodigy, I was a bit of computer whiz.

One day, my brother taught me about HTML. He showed me that if you write in a notepad file and save it with `.html` at the end of it, that the computer recognizes it as a web page. A couple of inline styles and anchor tags later, and my Dragon Ball Z drawings and MS paint renderings soon materialized into a homemade DBZ fan page (which unfortunately didnâ€™t survive 2004).

A few things have happened from now since then (namely Myspace, bad haircuts, puberty, university, a career) but I still get lost inside my computer tinkering around and learning new ways to conjure things onto the screen.
