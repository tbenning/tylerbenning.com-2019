At Top Hat, weâ€™re in higher education. Higher education works in semesters. So we work in semesters.

Each semester we have something called Engineering week. Engineering week is the time that everyone stops doing product based sprint work and focuses on a list of projects proposed and pitched by engineers.

I have a dinky metaphor to share that I stole from the Eng leads. Say youâ€™re in a forest chopping trees, but you never have time to sharpen your axe because youâ€™re always too busy chopping trees. Engineering week is the time to stop and sharpen your axe.

This year in the winter semester, I pitched, planned, and led my own engineering week project, notably titled FE4 Prototyping . I pitched it as a chance to use our component library to build simple front-end prototypes (and as a bonus become best friends with me for a week ðŸ‘¬).

A senior developer Jeremy jumped at the chance to be my best friend, and took a chance on the first design led Engineering week project. I estimated t-shirt sizes for the project and mapped out different projects that could be worked on, big and small.

Jeremy and I settled on a simple project to set up a create-react-app and use our front-end library to build an improved course lobby. Iâ€™d lead the design, and also implement it with Jeremyâ€™s coaching.

I did a bit of research to understand the data behind how the lobby was used. After a quick request to the `#analytics` Slack channel, I found some useful data on how many courses users have.

It turns out lots of users have >4 courses, so I thought it might be nice to improve the UI with a list view that users could toggle to. I wanted to tighten up some other UI details while I was at it, and add some other helpful links to other Top Hat resources that often get missed by others.

Jeremy spent the first day setting up `create-react-app` with our front-end library. There were hiccups along the way. While Jeremy showed me how to set up my dev environment, I wrote up a ReadMe for others to use.

I spent the next couple of days piecing together my design, getting coaching and mentoring from Jeremy along the way.

We investigated other more complex projects, but made sure to finish the week with a tangible thing that weâ€™d built.

By the end of the week we had another team set up and use the front-end prototyping app for their own project!
