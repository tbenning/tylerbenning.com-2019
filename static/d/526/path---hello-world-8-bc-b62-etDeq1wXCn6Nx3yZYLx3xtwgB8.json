Recently, I became interested in Javascript, React, and I built this site with Gatsby to boot. I think stories are an important part of design, and are what help people think on the same wavelength. This website is a place to share some of my own stories.</p>\n<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>\n<p>I grew up in the <a href=\"\">boonies</a> in a farmhouse and had too much time to kill. When I was 7, my brother taught me how to use our family computer. I quickly discovered that computers were magical, and that I could harness these powers. I started playing games like Doom, Command &#x26; Conquer, Warcraft, and SimCity daily. I learned to download music on Napster and burn mixed CDs for my Walkman to impress friends at school. My friendsâ€™ parents started asking me to fix their computers, and I even made a bit of money doing it. I learned to record music, make videos, and how to play around with Photoshop. While not a child programmer prodigy, I was a bit of computer whiz.</p>\n<p>One day, my brother taught me about HTML. He showed me that if you write in a notepad file and save it with <code class=\"language-text\">.html</code> at the end of it, that the computer recognizes it as a web page. A couple of inline styles and anchor tags later, and my Dragon Ball Z drawings and MS paint renderings soon materialized into a homemade DBZ fan page (which unfortunately didnâ€™t survive 2004).</p>\n<p>A few things have happened from now since then (namely Myspace, bad haircuts, puberty, university, a career) but I still get lost inside my computer tinkering around and learning new ways to conjure things onto the screen.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">SUM Stuff goes here</code></pre></div>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/3f5a1/salty_egg.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/f8fb9/salty_egg.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/e8976/salty_egg.jpg 148w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/63df2/salty_egg.jpg 295w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/f8fb9/salty_egg.jpg 590w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/85e3d/salty_egg.jpg 885w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/d1924/salty_egg.jpg 1180w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/9452e/salty_egg.jpg 1770w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/3f5a1/salty_egg.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>ðŸŽ¨ðŸ–¥âœ¨</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://unsplash.it/1024/760?random\" alt=\"User flow\"></p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4n0xNbfJLR8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one/#deploying-a-gatsby-site\">Gatsby Building Blocks</a></p>\n<h2>Table</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Stuff</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Other stuff</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">stuff1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Other stuff 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">stuff2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Other stuff 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sweet Pandas","date":"August 10, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ibm-loss-event-entry/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Loss Event Entry"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/top-hat-ux-quickwins-on-mobile/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UX Quickwins on Mobile"}}}}
