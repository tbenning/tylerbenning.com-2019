I\nquickly discovered how magical computers can be.\n\nI started playing games like Doom, Command &amp; Conquer, Warcraft, and\nSimCity daily. I learned to download music and burn mixed CDs to\nimpress friends at school. My friends’ parents started asking me to\nfix their computers, and I even made a bit of money doing it. I\nlearned to use audio interfaces to record music, DV cameras to make\nvideos, and how to play around with graphics in Photoshop. I wasn’t a\nchild prodigy programmer, but I was a bit of computer whiz that could\nlearn new tools quick.\n\nOne day, my brother taught me about HTML. He showed me that if you\nwrite in a notepad file and save it with &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; at the\nend, that the computer recognizes it as a web page. A couple of inline\nstyles and anchor tags later, and my Dragon Ball Z drawings and MS\npaint renderings soon materialized into a homemade DBZ fan page.{&#39; &#39;}\n\nA few things have happened from now since then (namely Myspace, bad\nhaircuts, puberty, university, a career) but I still get lost inside\nmy computer tinkering around and learning new ways to conjure things\nonto the screen.</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Site","dateRange":"Dec 2018 - Present"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/kid-years/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/personal-projects/tylerbenning-website/tylerbenning-website/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Site"}}}}
