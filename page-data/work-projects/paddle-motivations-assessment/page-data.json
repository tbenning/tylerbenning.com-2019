Through our cross-discipline design activities, everyone at Paddle had a say when designing and building the next product features. We moved quick and made decisions together on the fly.</p>\n<p>Our small team looks like this:\nCEO Business Development / Content\nProduct Manager / Content\nTwo Developers\nProduct Designer\nCo-op Student</p>\n<h2>My Role</h2>\n<p>I had ownership over the design of the product from end-to-end.

Over evening drinks, late nights in the office, and seeing the general comings and goings, I got a great feel for the entrepreneurial spirit. I’ve grasped many new aspects of how a business is run, and what it takes to build something valuable that people want.</p>\n<p>That said, my new favourite reads are Paul Graham’s essays (even if I don’t agree with him all of the time). I think about the future and what products will exist there. I’ve become obsessed with new products on Product Hunt, up and comers on Angel List, and the latest funding on Crunchbase. Entrepreneurship culture is neat.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html\">Essays</a></p>\n<p>Design-driven companies are becoming the norm thanks to the likes of Google Ventures, AirBnb, and more. I used my time at Paddle as an opportunity to share my knowledge about how to use design as a tool for business. I helped make sure they could take a design-driven approach to building their business, by putting the user first and testing early and often!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Motivations Assessment","dateRange":"Feb 2016 - Sep 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/work-projects/paddle-motivations-assessment/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/personal-projects/all-contributors/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Launching an Open Source Brand"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/work-projects/top-hat-classroom/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The iOS Classroom Experience"}}}}}
