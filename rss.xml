I try to measure how interesting of a person I am based on how many drawings I have. Sometimes I‚Äôll see 5-6 pages in a row of writing only, and realize I‚Äôm becoming dull, so I try to draw or sketch something instead.&lt;/p&gt;

I helped them launch their first self-assessment tool, and continued to consult with them in my spare time over the coming years. I‚Äôve worked on everything from product design, to conference banners, to pitch decks with the team. We‚Äôve developed a great relationship over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2018, Pat the CEO, took me out for a beer and enlisted my help for a new product they wanted to work on, which would help promote internal mobility at large enterprise companies. The product was still in its infancy and they needed help to turn a vision and a bit of research into a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got ready to put my facilitator hat on, and started preparing to kick off a 3 day problem discovery workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Days to Discover&lt;/strong&gt;
The team had already done some preliminary research with customers, employees, and managers to understand how internal mobility and careers at large companies worked. We used this qualitative data to make a user journey map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[JOURNEY MAP HERE]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the product was still in its nascency, we did an activity to articulate a a vision statement to guide to the team as we moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Vision IMG]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this journey map we identified high and low level problems that employees and managers might face when looking at internal movements. We diverged to condense these problems into grouped themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[GROUPED THEMEs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the next session working on different solutions for these problems. At IBM, I‚Äôd learned an exercise called ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù which are a helpful way to articulate solutions that weren‚Äôt too feature driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[IMAGES HERE]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After voting on our favourite ideas, we started sketching out bigger ideas on our own. This lead to a smattering of good ideas that we could continue to reference as the product progressed. We still have this backlog of ideas posted up in the office. If you work on a product and you keep circling back on a similar idea, it‚Äôs usually a good sign that it might be a promising feature for your product. Sometimes you just have to sit back and listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[IMAGES]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we had worked through a good storyboard (thanks to AJ&amp;#x26;Smarts helpful hacks!), I took the designs away and started to create hifi designs that we could use to test with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Testing&lt;/strong&gt;
The worst thing you can do is think of an idea and build the whole product without talking to any users or customers. One of the other team members Ankur took the lead on user testing and getting customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking to some customers, we saw a need that we could fill with one of our previous ideas ‚ÄúInternal Roles Board‚Äù. In this idea, users could discover and learn about different roles that existed in the company, then eventually apply to jobs in these roles at the right time. It fit in perfectly with the other ideas we had, but allowed for a better end-to-end experience that felt like a complete enough MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI Design&lt;/strong&gt;
Before I got to involved in building out UI mocks, I wanted to make sure the developers and I were on the same page, so we could build the UI efficiently using a shared system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out the the developers had made some decisions around front end architecture. We would use a blended Design System that took advantage of Semantic UI for major components. I had some flexibility to modify Type, Colors, and icons. We would build some simple components on our own, and implement Styled Components to customize some semantic UI components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.styled-components.com/&quot;&gt;styled-components&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I worked on a couple of iterations building out some simple UI concepts. I passed the assets off in Zeplin for the developers to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch&lt;/strong&gt;
We‚Äôre still in the early phases of launching it with one of their current customers. We meet weekly to talk about progress, user adoption, UI fixes, iterative work, and to prioritize what to work on next.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Motivations Assessment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Overview Paddle is a seed funded startup that offers career exploration tools.

&lt;p&gt;Paddle is a seed funded startup that offers career exploration tools. The first product offering is a self assessment tool that helps you understand your motivations and recommends industries suited to what will motivate you. The second offering is a learning platform that aids user‚Äôs next steps in learning about these industries. The product helps users to build their career path and keep them motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.mypaddle.co/warmup&quot;&gt;Paddle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects I worked on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 February: Paddle Branding &amp;#x26; Logo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 March-May: Motivations Assessment MVP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 May-July: Next Steps Career Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 August: Marketing Emails HTML/CSS Templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 August: Premium Paywall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 September: Soft Launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 December: Pitch Deck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 October-December (full-time): Paddle 2.0 Overhaul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Team&lt;/strong&gt;
We had a small team focused on the product. Through our cross-discipline design activities, everyone at Paddle had a say when designing and building the next product features. We moved quick and made decisions together on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our small team looks like this:
CEO Business Development / Content
Product Manager / Content
Two Developers
Product Designer
Co-op Student&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had ownership over the design of the product from end-to-end. As the first non-founder hire at an early stage startup, I was able to wear multiple hats and work closely with the founders to turn their vision into something more tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a t-shaped designer means I did a variety of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research &amp;#x26; usability testing
Product design thinking &amp;#x26; workshops
Interaction design (my vertical!)
UI design &amp;#x26; style guide
Branding &amp;#x26; marketing
HTML/CSS fixes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being at a startup = Entrepreneurship 101. Over evening drinks, late nights in the office, and seeing the general comings and goings, I got a great feel for the entrepreneurial spirit. I‚Äôve grasped many new aspects of how a business is run, and what it takes to build something valuable that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, my new favourite reads are Paul Graham‚Äôs essays (even if I don‚Äôt agree with him all of the time). I think about the future and what products will exist there. I‚Äôve become obsessed with new products on Product Hunt, up and comers on Angel List, and the latest funding on Crunchbase. Entrepreneurship culture is neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html&quot;&gt;Essays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design-driven companies are becoming the norm thanks to the likes of Google Ventures, AirBnb, and more. I used my time at Paddle as an opportunity to share my knowledge about how to use design as a tool for business. I helped make sure they could take a design-driven approach to building their business, by putting the user first and testing early and often!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[UX Quickwins on Mobile]]></title><description><![CDATA[As the lead designer for iOS and Android, I‚Äôd inherited UI that didn‚Äôt feel like it belonged to the same family as our web product. The‚Ä¶]]></description><link>http://tbenning.github.io/tylerbenning.com//work-projects/top-hat-ux-quickwins/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://tbenning.github.io/tylerbenning.com//work-projects/top-hat-ux-quickwins/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the lead designer for iOS and Android, I‚Äôd inherited UI that didn‚Äôt feel like it belonged to the same family as our web product. The typography, colours, and UI was messy and didn‚Äôt really follow a system. There were lots of small inconsistencies and interaction design issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[IMG HERE]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mobile team was centralized and small. We had priorities to stabilize crash rates, keep up with new features being introduced to the product, and fix the app whenever there were new OS releases. Sprint after sprint, design kept getting put on the back burner as ‚Äúsomething we‚Äôll do once we finish up this other important work‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few frustrating months of trying to get buy in to prioritize a UI refresh, we agreed on an alternative approach that we now call &lt;strong&gt;UX Quick Wins.&lt;/strong&gt; Over the course of a year and a half, we slowly chipped away at design debt while continuing to do other important work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice something wrong in the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a JIRA ticket to fix it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a design, show it to the developers and other designers, and iterate on the design based on feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach a new design to the ticket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get it bundled into the next sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another infrastructural piece that was missing was common tooling between design and development. We weren‚Äôt speaking the same language, and I noticed we were spending a lot of time determining colours, typography, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Top Hat, every semester we have one week called &lt;strong&gt;Engineering Week&lt;/strong&gt;. During this week, the devs have the opportunity to stop chopping down trees, and instead sharpen their axes and work on infrastructure. During this week I worked closely with the mobile developers to set up a proper design system of styles that we would build from. This would reduce the effort when passing off designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created rules around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spacing (8pt grid system with 16pt margins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colour palette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Icon system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enforce this system we used Zeplin to create the library of styles, and drafted a ReadMe in Github. I even downloaded Xcode and Android Studio to dig into their styles and patterns and remove unnecessary colours, icons. After engineering week, I now had the ability to pull branches of work, run a simulator, demo, and give feedback to the developers when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this system was put in place, our UX Quick Wins started rapidly picking up speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log In Flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Course Flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course Lobby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty States and Illustrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classroom answered/unanswered + tree state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation titles + Icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we‚Äôre still working on UX quick wins and it‚Äôs not over yet. Here are some examples of improvements we‚Äôve been able to make over the past year, all while stabilizing the infrastructure, reducing crash rates, and keeping up with projects from other teams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Launching an Open Source Brand]]></title><description><![CDATA[My friend from work Jake has pioneered the open source initiative at work, and has been getting more involved in different projects and‚Ä¶]]></description><link>http://tbenning.github.io/tylerbenning.com//personal-projects/all-contributors/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://tbenning.github.io/tylerbenning.com//personal-projects/all-contributors/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My friend from work Jake has pioneered the open source initiative at work, and has been getting more involved in different projects and communities. He‚Äôs the guy that pops up at designer‚Äôs desks to ask for logos, UI mocks flag and coffee mug designs for sometimes-neat-ideas he‚Äôs stewing over. This wasn‚Äôt the first time Jake has asked me for a favour, and likely won‚Äôt be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jake:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey Tyler, wanna do a logo for something. Check it.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/all-contributors&quot;&gt;All Contributors ¬∑ GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyler:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, okay. I‚Äôll sketch a couple ideas and wrap something up tomorrow night. I‚Äôm leaving for vacay at the end of the week, so I‚Äôll see if I can pump out some quick ideas before I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say? I‚Äôm a sucker for enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, I lazily browsed the repo, scrawled some shapes in my notebook, and made a few shitlogos that felt uninspired and weren‚Äôt very good. I called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I actually &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; about the project, and realized it was a pretty neat idea that already had a good amount of traction. Bring everyone and their contributions into GitHub‚Äôs open source community. Get all hands on deck for open source projects, and motivate more people across different disciplines to contribute. Lower the barriers for adding contributors. Leave no contributor behind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. I actually love this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling refreshed, I went through another quick round of designs about an hour before hopping on a flight to Costa Rica. I quickly sent a mock of ~10 logos to Jake. Because it was 3AM, I guess Jake wasn‚Äôt awake, so I pulled the trigger and sent an SVG of what I thought worked best. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have a laptop on vacation, and sometimes you‚Äôve just gotta go with your gut. My Uber was downstairs and I had to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the logo pays homage to the ‚ú® emoji that the project owner Kent Dodds had used on the project since it started. We wanted to build on it, but add more flair and ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù symbolism ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of time to think while sipping Imperial lagers on the beach. I‚Äôd been doing some research on open source communities for a work project, and I decided that I wanted in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyler:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to get more involved with the project. Let‚Äôs chat when I‚Äôm back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jake:&lt;/strong&gt; Right-o! Chat ya when you‚Äôre back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following weekend I sat down with Jake and got him to explain All Contributors to me as simply as possible. He told me about the existing project, and the bot that he‚Äôd built to add contributors to the ReadMe page of your repo. I try to get people to repeat things and teach me a concept until it‚Äôs simple enough for anyone to grasp. Then I repeat it back to them to check if it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the brain dump, I took this information and wrote a draft of content for a homepage. Since it‚Äôs a marketing page, the goal is to concisely teach users how it works, and then them to install the Github Bot. Simple marketing magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later I had a Sketch mockup finished, so I sent it around the All Contributors Slack group to get some feedback. Next day I cloned the website repo, and coded the page directly inside the Docusaurus app. I made a pull request, got it reviewed, and a few days later the site was up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the project, tell your friends, and try out the bot on your own Open Source project!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Portfolio Site]]></title><description><![CDATA[How I Designed This Designing a portfolio isn‚Äôt rocket science.

&lt;p&gt;Designing a portfolio isn‚Äôt rocket science. It‚Äôs a basic website that has a few pages worth of content. Regardless of its simplicity, I still approached this project the same way I approach most design projects. Figure out who the users are and what they want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the conversations I‚Äôd had around my past portfolios (v1 v2), I figured that most users were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recruiters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring managers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other designers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I expect people to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judge üßê&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimizing for Reading &amp;#x26; Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I expect users to read and learn on this site. What kinds of sites are optimized for reading? Well after months of perusing various documentation sites (React, Gatsby, MDN web docs), the answer was pretty obvious. Sidebars dwell within most documentation sites because of their power to guide users through content. The choice was simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this site, I figured that if I use a sidebar, it would remove the need to go back to fiddle back and forth between the project list page, and the project write-ups. Less scrolling. Less clicks. Less cognitive load. Just click the next one in the menu! Sure, it only really saves a quick click here and there, but it adds up when you‚Äôre short on time and trying to flip between projects to figure out if this ‚ÄúTyler guy‚Äù even knows what he‚Äôs talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I also added keyboard navigation for lazy people and power users.-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MVisual design is a finicky thing. It has the power to help with usability, convey ideas, and generally give you a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù about a site. My hope is to convince you that I‚Äôm not a total bore of a designer that only knows how to draw boxes on screens, and to make you feel good about your interaction on this site. I also want to show that I can be creative damnit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin the process, I drew out a few layout concepts on paper, which I then pieced together in Sketch. I wanted to add brand elements, but also make it feel personal. Sometimes I look at other designers‚Äô portfolio sites, and can‚Äôt help but feel disconnected from the designer. Generally work is supposed to speak for itself, but I want users to feel pleasant, as if they‚Äôre meeting me in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remedy this situation, I dug up the best ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù photo I could find, that a friend had taken of me. I‚Äôm a sucker for mixed media illustrations, and decided to flex my Photoshop skills to build some brand materials. Over the years, I‚Äôve been using illustrations that I pulled from a pattern on my favourite shirt to craft my personal brand. I did some masking and colour tweaking with layer styles, and put together the hero image you now see on the front page today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a content site, I made the typography straightforward with large headings in IBM Plex Sans, that I paired with Google Font‚Äôs PT Serif. It‚Äôs amazing what a little CSS can do to really make a site shine.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/&quot;&gt;Perfect Motherfucking Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I Built This&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a decade ago, I‚Äôd started learning HTML/CSS, Javascript, and PHP in school. I‚Äôd built some Wordpress sites, and a couple of CRUD sites for school projects. I was frustrated with CSS floats and that I couldn‚Äôt centre anything vertically in a div. Soon after, I dove headfirst into a career in design, leaving coding (mostly) behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2018, I decided I‚Äôd test the waters and look at how front-end tools have evolved. I found Flexbox. After Wes Bos‚Äô Course, and now I feel like a born-again Christian, with a newfound love for CSS layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning git, set up a Github, and enrolled in a Javascript course at HackerYou. I started compiling a huge list of resources and used this roadmap to decide on what to learn. It turns out there‚Äôs loads of resources for designers who want to learn more code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flexbox.io/&quot;&gt;What The Flexbox?! ‚Äî A simple 20 video course that will help you master CSS Flexbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackeryou.com/&quot;&gt;HackerYou | Learn to code in Toronto | Courses, Workshops, &amp;#x26; IT Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs important to have projects while learning. After I‚Äôd completed a few jQuery assignments (project 1, project 2) for my HackerYou course, I wanted to dive into React and figure out what all the buzz was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started taking some online tutorials from Wes Bos and Meng To to get a feel for React. I discovered Gatsby, and bought into the buzz surrounding the project. I read through all the Gatsby docs, and decided Gatsby was perfect for my needs. I installed Styled Components and Prettier, and started structuring my content in markdown files. I picked up just enough GraphQL to grab data from my markdown files, and get my site up and running on Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inspirational People and Projects on the Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so grateful for all of the people who have put together such great content to learn from and be inspired by. I‚Äôd be so lost without these awesome people and projects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How I Wrote This&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing isn‚Äôt easy. I spent a great deal of time (probably too much) reflecting and digging through past projects. This is the fun part of creating a portfolio. You stop, reflect, and think back on old projects, parse through all of the design assets, and consider all of the decisions you‚Äôd made in the process. I think this exercise in itself helps you grow as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing words is tough. These resources helped me to find the words you currently see in front of you. Writing is a journey, and I‚Äôll continue

&lt;p&gt;As for my writing tools, I write everything using Bear. I found it a few months back, and now I write all my notes on Bear. There‚Äôs a handy feature where you can copy everything as markdown, so I just copy and paste everything from Bear to my markdown files. Sure, there are more elegant CMS‚Äô, but I don‚Äôt mind updating my markdown files manually and pushing them to Github pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SOS: Send Help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a wild ride getting this thing going, if you‚Äôre curious about the source code for this site, check the project out on Github. I always appreciate feedback on how to improve the site and refactor my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, fork it and use it for your own portfolio or blog project!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Loss Event Entry]]></title><description><![CDATA[Problem Picture this.

&lt;p&gt;Picture this. You manage a team of currency traders at a large bank and you find that one of your team members made a mistake while trading currencies that cost your department $50,000. At this point, it‚Äôs your team‚Äôs responsibility to report a loss event to the risk management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do next? Who do you tell? Who‚Äôs accountable? How do you collect more information? What system do you need to use to record the information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üòÖüòÖüòÖ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting loss events at banks can be scary. You‚Äôre stressed about the mistake that was made, and now you have to figure out the rigorous process to report it to the risk team. In an ideal world, everyone in a company would work together to report loss events, but communication problems, team silos, and difficult pieces of legacy software prevent teams from working together and submitting these events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our customers needed an elegant solution for infrequent and non-users of OpenPages to submit loss events quickly and easily, so that they could improve risk management practices across the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the team lead and user experience designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in Toronto, our team of 4 worked remotely with the OpenPages product management and development teams in Massachusetts and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinating remotely with our Product Manager and Developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborating on initial research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating customer-facing workshops for problem discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team sketching sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low fidelity prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing prototypes for validity and usability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting design ‚Äúplaybacks‚Äù to our remote teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team was usually juggling multiple projects at once. Loss Event Entry is one of about eight projects I worked on with the OpenPages team, which we completed over the course of 3 months from initial scope to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan, our user researcher and I lead design activities with teams at two separate ‚ÄúBig Five Banks‚Äù in Toronto. We facilitated journey mapping exercises to map out the loss event process in different teams. We learned a lot from the study, but the participants were surprised to find that they learned more about their own processes throughout the exercise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few emergent themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad Hoc Processes&lt;/strong&gt;
Events are documented and submitted in ad-hoc processes, which change across the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;
It‚Äôs necessary for different actors to work together when collecting information about a loss event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability matters&lt;/strong&gt;
We found an internal tool that was built to capture loss events, but was failing to do the job properly because it was over 100 inputs long, with no helper text, and 90% of the fields were mandatory. &lt;em&gt;Nobody used it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design &amp;#x26; Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a designer, I believe it can be important to ideate without major constraints to understand an ideal user-centred solution, and then scale back based on constraints. It‚Äôs important to expand the teams understanding of what‚Äôs possible, but also take a balanced perspective to come to a good compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned what our users needed, but we also needed to decide what was the essential job that our product could fulfill, and what was extra. To understand the technical constraints, I worked with the development team to get a sense of what types of information we could access to via their REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together a user journey and low fidelity mocks of the ideal solution. We worked with our Product Manager Bob, and our technical leads to undergo various rounds of iteration and feedback to come to a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Within Constraints&lt;/strong&gt;
We stripped down the collaborative features, and built a form that users could work through incrementally. We made only absolutely necessary fields required, and added an area for helpful tool tips. We used progressive disclosure, so that users could work through bitesized chunks of data input, and skip areas that didn‚Äôt apply to their type of loss event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our UI designer Jasmine picked a colour scheme, type scale, and spacing that would work well to balance that information architecture but also adhere to the IBM Design Guide. She worked closely with our front end developer Susan to build a simple front end prototype in Angular, which we brought back to customers to perform user testing. We found usability improvements and workflow improvements that we were able to get into the production build of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was finished with a few weeks to spare, so we had the appropriate time to test and get extra UI polish and copywriting changes into the final version.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
